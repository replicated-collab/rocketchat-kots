# Q: Why does this exist? 
# R: Countour can't, for some incomprehensible reason, act normally and just 
# support Websockets like Tr√¶fik (and pretty much everybody else) does. 
# Instead of a normal Ingress, you have to create this HTTPProxy CRD 
# (previously known as IngressRoute).

# Q: What if a non-kURL install has Countour? 
# R: Well... What to say? We will deal with it when the time comes. Ideally, 
# we should've fixed on our Helm charts, but it may unveil new issues. So, 
# it will be done after we fix the most troublesome issues, like kURL being 
# unable to deal with websockets.
